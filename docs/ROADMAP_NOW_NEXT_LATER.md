# Roadmap: Now → Next → Later

**Last review:** January 7, 2026 (Week 1)  
**Progress:** 7/11 MVP issues complete (64%)  
**Critical blocker:** IVA-29 (contextual patterns bug)  
**Target:** Demo-ready backend API by January 31, 2026

---

## 🔥 NOW (This Week - Jan 6-12, 2026)

**Focus:** Fix critical bug → Unblock MVP

### This Week Priority

**Fix contextual patterns bug** to enable realistic, varied predictions. Currently all predictions return ~143 covers regardless of context (Christmas, weekend, events). This blocks credibility and Staff Recommender work.

### Issues

- [ ] **IVA-29:** 🔥 CRITICAL - Contextual patterns not applied (1h) - **BLOCKER**
  - Problem: Patterns always hardcoded (Coldplay/U2), Christmas treated as regular day
  - Impact: Predictions not credible (always ~143 covers)
  - Solution: Debug Python cache issue, verify contextual logic executes

### Success Criteria

- ✅ Christmas Day predicts 40-70 covers (not 143)
- ✅ Weekend vs weekday shows variation (100-160 range)
- ✅ Events boost covers (+15 per event)
- ✅ Weather affects predictions (rain -10 covers)
- ✅ Pattern dates recent (3-12 months ago, not 2023)

### Intelligence from Veille

<!-- Update each Monday 9am with relevant insights from Perplexity -->

**2026-01-07:** Initial roadmap creation
- No pending insights from veille yet
- First review scheduled: Monday January 13, 9am

---

## ⏭️ NEXT (Next 2-3 Weeks - Jan 13-26, 2026)

**Focus:** Complete Phase 1 MVP (4 remaining issues, ~4.5h effort)

### Issues

- [ ] **IVA-30:** Staff Recommender Agent (2h)
  - Adaptive staffing calculations based on predicted covers
  - Restaurant-specific configs (covers per server ratio)
  - Integration into prediction pipeline
  - **Blocked by:** IVA-29

- [ ] **IVA-31:** Integration test suite (1h)
  - 5 scenarios: weekend, weekday, holiday, rainy, New Year's Eve
  - Validate covers variation (not all ~143)
  - Pytest-ready for CI/CD
  - **Blocked by:** IVA-29

- [ ] **IVA-32:** Deploy to Render.com (1h)
  - Public demo URL: `https://fb-agent-mvp.onrender.com`
  - Swagger docs accessible
  - Deployment guide documentation

- [ ] **IVA-33:** Phase 1 limitations documentation (30min)
  - Honest assessment of what works/doesn't
  - Phase 2 roadmap preview
  - PM critical thinking demonstration

### Potential Additions from Veille

<!-- Capture new features discovered via industry intelligence -->

**To evaluate in weekly reviews:**
- None currently
- Will assess based on Perplexity Monday veille

### Success Criteria (Phase 1 Complete)

- ✅ All 11 MVP issues done
- ✅ Backend API publicly accessible
- ✅ 5 test scenarios passing
- ✅ Limitations documented transparently

---

## 📅 LATER (Phase 2-3 - Feb-Mar 2026)

**Focus:** Real integrations + Production features

### Phase 2 - Integrations (High Priority)

**Critical Path:**

- [ ] **IVA-13:** PMS integration (Mews/Apaleo) - **KEY DIFFERENTIATOR**
  - Occupancy rate → +15% F&B demand boost
  - Hotel conferences/events
  - VIP arrivals, dietary preferences
  - **Impact:** 40% prediction weight from internal data

- [ ] **Real APIs:** PredictHQ (events), Weather API
  - Replace mock data with real-time info
  - Improve prediction accuracy

- [ ] **Qdrant semantic search:** Real pattern matching
  - Replace hardcoded patterns
  - Vector similarity search
  - Contextual historical matches

### Phase 2 - UI Features (Medium Priority)

- [ ] **IVA-9:** Manager approval workflows
  - Validate/modify/reject predictions
  - State management (pending, approved, rejected)
  - Audit log

- [ ] **IVA-10:** Voice input (reevaluate after industry research)
  - Note: Noisy restaurant environments challenge voice
  - May defer based on veille insights

- [ ] **IVA-12:** ElevenLabs voice synthesis
  - Cost: ~$225/month vs $6.65 Claude API
  - Dependent on IVA-10 feasibility

### Backlog - Advanced Features (Low Priority)

- [ ] **IVA-11:** Command palette (Cmd+K style)
- [ ] **IVA-14:** NLU intent recognition
- [ ] **IVA-15:** Continuous learning + prediction accuracy tracking
- [ ] **IVA-16:** No-show risk prediction
- [ ] **IVA-17:** Semantic layer (PMS-agnostic)

### Ideas from Veille (To Scope Later)

<!-- Capture emerging technologies/features, evaluate ROI -->

**Potential explorations:**
- Claude MCP servers for PMS connectivity
- Anthropic Artifacts for manager dashboards
- New Qdrant features for pattern matching
- Hospitality-specific LLMs (if emerge)

**Evaluation criteria:**
- Does it accelerate Phase 2 timeline?
- Does it improve differentiation vs competitors?
- Is implementation effort justified?

## 🧠 Strategic Notes

### Key Learnings (Phase 0-1)

**Architecture Decisions:**
- ✅ Dashboard-first (not voice-first) - industry requires visual transparency
- ✅ Agentic-first (not API-first) - aligns with Augmented Hospitality
- ✅ Explainability critical (EU AI Act, GDPR Article 22)

**Product Insights:**
- Christmas edge case = critical for credibility (50 covers vs 143)
- Internal context (PMS) = 40% prediction accuracy
- Pattern variation > reasoning quality for demo impact

**PM Competencies Demonstrated:**
- Critical thinking: Identified Christmas incohérence
- Domain expertise: Server background = operations understanding
- Honest assessment: Documented limitations vs over-promising

### Next Pivots to Consider

**If Perplexity veille shows:**
- New Claude features (MCP, tools) → Evaluate integration acceleration
- Competitor launches (HotSchedules AI) → Emphasize differentiators
- Regulatory updates (EU AI Act) → Adjust explainability features
- New PMS APIs (Mews updates) → Reprioritize integration work

**Decision framework:**
- High impact + Low effort → Add to NEXT
- High impact + High effort → Plan for Phase 2
- Low impact → Reject or defer to Backlog
